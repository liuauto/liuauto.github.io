<p>Jie Liu is currently a data scientist at Conversant, LLC.</p>
<!-- ><p>Professor Boyd is the author of many research articles and three books:
<i>Convex Optimization</i> (with Lieven Vandenberghe, 2004),
<i>Linear Matrix Inequalities in System and Control Theory</i> (with L. El Ghaoui, 
E. Feron, and V. Balakrishnan, 1994), 
and
<i>Linear Controller Design: Limits of Performance</i>
(with Craig Barratt, 1991).
His group has produced many open source tools, including
CVX (with Michael Grant), CVXPY (with Steven Diamond) and
Convex.jl (with Madeleine Udell and others),
widely used parser-solvers for convex optimization.</p>
<p>Professor Boyd has received many awards
and honors for his research in control systems engineering and
optimization, including 
an ONR Young Investigator Award, a Presidential Young 
Investigator Award,
and the AACC Donald P. Eckman Award, given 
annually for the greatest contribution to the field of control 
engineering by someone under the age of 35.
In 2013, he received the IEEE Control Systems Award, given for
outstanding contributions to control systems engineering, 
science, or technology.
In 2012, Michael Grant and he were given the Mathematical 
Optimization Society's Beale-Orchard-Hays Award,
given every three years for
excellence in computational mathematical programming.
He is a Fellow of the IEEE, SIAM, and INFORMS, a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE 
Control Systems Society, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.
He has been invited to deliver more than 90 plenary and 
keynote lectures at major conferences in control,
optimization, signal processing, and machine learning.</p>
<p>He has developed and taught many undergraduate and graduate courses,
including Signals & Systems, Linear Dynamical Systems, 
Convex Optimization, and a recent
undergraduate course on Matrix Methods.  His graduate
convex optimization course
attracts more than 300 students from more than 25 departments.
In 1991 he received an ASSU Graduate Teaching Award,
and in 1994 he received the Perrin Award 
for Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching in the School of
Engineering.
In 2003, he received the AACC Ragazzini Education award, for
contributions to control education, with citation:
&ldquo;For excellence in classroom teaching, textbook
and monograph preparation, and undergraduate and graduate
mentoring of students in the area of systems, control,
and optimization.&rdquo;
In 2016 he received the Walter J. Gores award, the highest award for
teaching at Stanford University, with (excerpt from) citation
&ldquo;For revolutionizing the way mathematical optimization is taught and
applied in engineering and the social and natural sciences worldwide;
For the brilliance, clarity and humor with which he presents
mathematically advanced topics, makes them accessible and interesting to
students in many fields.&rdquo;
In 2017 he received the IEEE James H. Mulligan, Jr. Education Medal,
for a career of outstanding contributions to education in the fields of interest 
of IEEE, with citation &ldquo;For inspirational education of students and researchers in
the theory and application of optimization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His website, which makes available past papers, books, software, lecture notes,
and selected lecture videos, is visited more than 1.6 million times per year,
not counting accesses to iTunes U, YouTube, Stanford Engineering Everywhere,
MIT Open Course Ware, and Stanford Online/edX,
which include courses developed and delivered by Boyd.</p>
<p>At Stanford he has served as
director of the Information Systems Laboratory, 
chair of the (university wide) Library Committee,
chair of the David Packard EE Building Planning & Design
Committee, and as a member of the (university wide) Advisory Board.</p>
