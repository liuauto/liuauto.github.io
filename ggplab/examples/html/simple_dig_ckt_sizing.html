% This is an example taken directly from the paper:
%
%   A Tutorial on Geometric Programming (see pages 25-29)
%   by Boyd, Kim, Vandenberghe, and Hassibi.
%
% Solves the problem of choosing gate scale factors x_i to give
% minimum ckt delay, subject to limits on the total area and power.
%
%   minimize   D
%       s.t.   P <= Pmax, A <= Amax
%              x >= 1
%
% where variables are scale factors x.
%
% This code is specific to the digital circuit shown in figure 4
% (page 28) of GP tutorial paper. All the constraints and
% the worst-case delay expression are hard-coded for this
% particular circuit.
% 
% A more general code with more precise models for digital cicuit
% sizing is also available as part of the ggplab examples library.
