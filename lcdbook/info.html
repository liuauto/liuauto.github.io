************************************

The main topic of the book is closed-loop design and the computation
of performance limits using convexity.  The book introduces a standard
framework for the control design problem and describes many practical
design specifications in this framework.  It is shown that many of
these specifications are closed-loop convex; the corresponding control
design problems can therefore be cast as infinite-dimensional
nondifferentiable convex optimization problems.  The book shows how
these problems can be solved using the ellipsoid and cutting-plane
algorithms, using a Ritz approximation.

The book describes how the achievable performance can be computed
numerically for any family of closed-loop convex specifications.
Closed-loop convex specifications include, for example, H-two,
H-infinity, or l-one norm bounds, entropy bounds, step response
envelopes and asymptotic command decoupling.

The book contains many previously unpublished results.  The clear
exposition and numerous examples make the material accessible to a
wide audience, including researchers, graduate students and industrial
control engineers.  The book includes standalone chapters covering
norms of signals and systems, and their computation, as well as
standalone chapters covering convex analysis and nondifferentiable
convex optimization.

Over 27000 lines of matlab source were written to generate the
numerical examples and 216 plots and figures. To the authors'
knowledge, the extent of the numerical computation in this book is
unprecedented in a book on control systems.
