Includes full C source (which calls LAPACK), which can be used 
directly or via matlab mex file interfaces, matlab examples, 
and documentation.

CONTENTS: 
The FTP directory pub/boyd/maxdet at isl.stanford.edu contains
the following files:
- README: this file
- maxdet.tar.Z: the package, including all source files and 
  documentation, but no executable files 
- maxdet.mexds.Z: the executable mex-interface for DECstations
- maxdet.mex4.Z: the executable mex-interface for SUN4/Sparcstations (SunOS)
- maxdet.mexsol.Z: the executable mex-interface for SUN4 (solaris)
- maxdet.mexhp7.Z: the executable mex-interface for HP 9000/700 series


TO INSTALL THE PACKAGE:
1. Move maxdet.tar.Z to the directory where you want the code to 
   live. Then:

   your-machine> zcat maxdet.tar.Z | tar xvf -

   This creates a directory maxdet with C sources, MATLAB m-files and 
   two subdirectories: maxdet/EXAMPLES (containing MATLAB example 
   files), and maxdet/DOC (containing a postscript file doc.ps with 
   documentation, and a copy of the companion paper "Determinant 
   Maximization with Linear Matrix Inequality Constraints" in 
   compressed postscript).

2. To install the mex-interface on your machine:
   - either go to maxdet, edit the Makefile, type make to compile 
     your own mex-file,
   - or, if your machine is a DECstation, Sun4 or Sparcstation, 
     or HP workstation of the 9000/700 series, ftp one of the 
     executable mex-interface maxdet.mexXXX.Z, and 

     your-machine> uncompress maxdet.mexXXX

     Here `XXX' stands for `ds' if you have a DECstation, `4' if you 
     have a SUN4 or Sparcstation, or `hp7' if you have an HP.


The documentation and the code are still under development. Please do 
not hesitate to send e-mail to clive@isl.stanford.edu,
vandenbe@isl.stanford.edu or boyd@isl.stanford.edu with your comments or
questions.
