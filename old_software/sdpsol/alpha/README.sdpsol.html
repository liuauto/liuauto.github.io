CONTENTS:
All files listed are compressed using gzip.
- usrguide.ps.gz: postscript user guide
- examples.tar.gz: tar file with many example problems
- sdpsol.dec.gz: executable for DECstations 5000
- sdpsol.sun4.gz: executable for SUN4 and Sparcstations
- sdpsol.hp9000.gz: executable for HP9000/700 workstations
- sdpsol.ibm_rs.gz: executable for IBM RS6000 workstations

TO INSTALL THE PACKAGE:
Get usrguide.ps.gz, examples.tar.gz, and the appropriate binary file 
(dec, sun4, hp or ibm).  Remember to set binary mode in ftp.
You can uncompress the usrguide with gunzip, gzip -d, or zcat(gzcat).
You can then view it with any postscript viewer or print it on any
postscript printer.  Move examples.tar.gz to the directory where you
want the examples to live.  zcat examples.tar.Z | tar xvf - will create
the examples directory.

BUG FIX (from the earlier alpha version, March 1995):
- incorrect entry-wise inequality constraint is fixed

NOTE:
sdpsol.ibm_rs is compiled on an IBM RS6000 machine with the help from
Marty Brenner <gonzo@xrd.dfrc.nasa.gov>.
